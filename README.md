## Laboratory tasks
### Laboratory task 1
I analysed state-space search problems and the complexity of various blind and heuristic search algorithms, including the Breadth-first Search algorithm, 
Uniform-Cost Search algorithm, A* algorithm, and optimism and consistency check of a heuristic function.
### Laboratory task 2
I implemented an automated reasoning system based on refutation resolution. The system is based on a refutation resolution algorithm.
### Laboratory task 3
I implemented the decision tree algorithm, specifically the ID3 algorithm, and analysed the problems and extensions of this machine learning algorithm. 
I evaluated model performance using the accuracy metric and the confusion matrix. Furthermore, I implemented the function of limiting the tree depth.
